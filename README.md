# The Rabbit hOle Creator Collection
The Rabbit hOle is an artist-driven non-profit organization dedicated to the creation of a new museum experience around literature. It is the World's First Explor-a-Storium, an immersive storybook wonderland and national center for the children's book.

## The Problem
Data is tracked manually with no framework in place for data standardization and it’s a tedious process to make updates. This contributes to the restricted access of knowledge.

## Our Solution
This web app allow users to access children’s book title and author information seamlessly, and will allow RH administrators to update and view book data quickly and more efficiently. This web app will be a literary research tool for parents and teachers who are interested in learning more about children’s book authors and creators. It is a collaborative effort with The Rabbit hOle, a startup non-profit that is creating a children’s literature museum in North Kansas City. It will allow program directors at RH to add and expand information and data about children’s authors.
